# Simple-Food-App
**This is Simple Food App**
*In this application, I have displayed a list of foods using RecycleView, and the photos of the foods are uploaded from the internet using Glide. This application has the ability to remove a food from the list. You can remove a food by long clicking delete. You can also change its specifications by clicking on a food item. You can also add your food by clicking on the button on the top of the page, but a random photo will be selected. You can also search for the food you want in the search section.*
